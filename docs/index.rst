OpenRPG: Stats
==============

Overview
--------

Welcome to the OpenRPG Stats system documentation! This **powerful, modular, flexible** and **efficient** stats system will allow you
to create not only stats with **buffs** and **effects**, but **also attributes** and **custom leveling system**, very common in most RPG games.
You will be able to **extend any actor functionality** in your game with the features of this system **easily** and getting it implemented very quickly!

It has been structured to be **easy to understand and follow**, so everyone is capable of understanding how the whole system works, and with
this documentation every aspect of it will be carefully explained. Even though im a completely beginner on documenting, i have tried to
structure it from a **general overview** of the folder structure and its content to a **deeper look** at each part of the whole system. On each part i will show
you some comprehensive guides that will clarify how to expand the system to adapt every aspect of it to your needs, as well as a look at the most important
blueprints that handles the overall system functionality, which are the actor components. Then you will learn how to migrate and integrate the system into
your own project.

.. Hint:: If you like it dont forget to leave a star on `GitHub <https://github.com/angelhodar/OpenRPG_Stats>`__
   and also it would be a huge help if you give me all your feedback about errors you find or some features that you would like to be implemented!
